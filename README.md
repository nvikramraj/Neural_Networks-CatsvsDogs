# Neural_Networks-CatsvsDogs
Deep Learning - Neural Network , Which can differentiate between cats and dogs


This is my first project on neural networks . The model has around 80% accuracy maximum .

p8_catvsdogs.py :
This is used to train the neural network.

p8_plottinggraph.py :
This is used to plot graphs like accuracy/loss vs time.

testing_p.py:
You can upload an image of cat/dog to check if the neural network can find if it's a cat or a dog.
